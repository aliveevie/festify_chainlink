# Festify Avax - Cross-Chain Festival Platform

Festify Avax is an innovative decentralized festival platform that demonstrates advanced cross-chain interoperability using Chainlink's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP). The project showcases seamless communication and asset movement between Avalanche networks and Ethereum-compatible chains, enabling users to create, manage, and participate in festivals across multiple blockchain ecosystems.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Architecture

### `/ccip-Interface` - Chainlink CCIP JavaScript SDK Integration
**Purpose**: A comprehensive interface for Chainlink's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP)

The `ccip-Interface` directory contains a complete implementation of Chainlink's CCIP JavaScript SDK, featuring:

- **`ccip-js`**: A TypeScript library providing a robust client for managing cross-chain token transfers using CCIP routers
- **`ccip-react-components`**: Pre-built, customizable UI components built on top of `ccip-js` for seamless integration
- **Next.js Example**: A fully functional example application demonstrating CCIP bridge functionality
- **Monorepo Structure**: Organized with pnpm workspaces for efficient development and builds

**Key Features:**
- Cross-chain token transfers with built-in security
- React components for rapid UI development
- TypeScript support for type-safe development
- Comprehensive testing suite with Jest
- Production-ready build system

**Development Commands:**
```bash
pnpm build              # Build all packages
pnpm dev-example        # Run the example application
pnpm test-ccip-js       # Run CCIP core tests
```

### `/frontend` - React-Based User Interface
**Purpose**: Modern, responsive web application for cross-chain festival management

The frontend is a sophisticated React application built with cutting-edge technologies:

**Technology Stack:**
- **React 18** with TypeScript for type-safe component development
- **Vite** for lightning-fast development and optimized builds
- **Tailwind CSS** with custom animations for modern styling
- **shadcn/ui** component library for consistent design system
- **Avalanche BuilderKit** for seamless Web3 integration
- **TanStack Query** for efficient data fetching and caching
- **React Router** for client-side navigation

**Key Features:**
- **Cross-Chain Messaging Interface**: Interactive form for sending festival data between chains
- **Multi-Chain Support**: Integration with Avalanche, Fuji testnet, Echo, and Dispatch chains
- **Wallet Integration**: ConnectButton component for user authentication
- **Transaction Monitoring**: Real-time transaction status tracking with Snowtrace integration
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first design with dark/light theme support

**Core Components:**
- `CrossChainMessaging.tsx`: Main interface for cross-chain festival data transmission
- Smart contract integration with deployed addresses:
  - Fuji Sender: `0x8df379BbCCFDa5E8A0ca0D14889d49ba39613F15`
  - Subnet Receiver: `0x75773539b96E90A18408a30b4eeb16D511B37AA4`

### `/cross-chain-avax/lib/icm-contracts/lib/subnet-evm/core/state/snapshot/context.go`
**Purpose**: Low-level blockchain state management for snapshot generation

This Go file is part of the Avalanche subnet-evm implementation, specifically handling snapshot context for state management:

**Technical Analysis:**
- **Origin**: Derived from go-ethereum library with Avalanche-specific modifications
- **Functionality**: Manages snapshot generation statistics and logging for blockchain state
- **Key Components**:
  - `generatorStats`: Collects statistics during snapshot generation (accounts, storage slots, timing)
  - Contextual logging with multiple severity levels (Trace, Debug, Info, Warn, Error, Crit)
  - ETA calculation for snapshot completion based on current progress
  - Memory-efficient progress tracking using binary encoding

**Performance Features:**
- Real-time progress monitoring with ETA calculations
- Detailed metrics tracking (accounts indexed, storage size, elapsed time)
- Optimized binary operations for large-scale state processing
- Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring
